> Kreators Guild enables children and adults to access the opportunity, capability, and freedom to design, learn, and create on their own. Through workshops, after-school programs, guided lessons, and competitive activities, we inspire future engineers and makers. Our goal is to provide all services to children for free, while adults subscribe monthly and pay for materials. We are open and accepting of any individual with a desire to learn, create, and do so responsibly. At Kreators Guild, we foster teamwork, encourage curiosity, and embrace learning from mistakes.
